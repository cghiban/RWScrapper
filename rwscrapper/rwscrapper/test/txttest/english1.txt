Aromanian grammar does have some features that distinguish it from Romanian, an important one being the complete disappearance of verb infinitives which is a shared feature of the Balkan sprachbund.

For the same reason, verb entries in dictionaries are given in their indicative mood, present tense, first person, singular form
